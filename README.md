A mini dashboard for PGG.  about 2-4 pages max  Description: A nice looking dashbaord where all of us can come and fill in the form of our details. and its major purpose is to have specific records of us and be able so send personalized email from the department in general to the person, on his or her birthday. and also emails to everyone when its their birthday so we can remember to wish them.  Now as lame as this sounds it can later be upgraded to Some more Efficient where course reps can upload import materials and results Basically sensitive stuffs so we actually never miss them If there's is a dashboard that everyone can just go and download materials and results whenever the hell they need it till we graduate. People that face whatsapp problems and loss of chats can easily log in to their dashboard and scroll to their courses and download all the materials whenever the hell they need it. Its basically 90% of our problem in that group chat, send me this send me that will reduce.  And the best part of it is that it reduces work load for the  coursereps having to disturb us everytime to fill a form as everyone infomation can be easily exported into an excel sheet for printing.
